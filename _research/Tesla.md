abstract: "<span style='font-size:0.85rem; line-height:1.6; display:block;'> <em>Abstract</em>: We examine the causal effects of Tesla’s unprecedented 2014 patent pledge on innovation diffusion and ecosystem development in the electric vehicle industry. Using a difference-in-differences design that compares citations to Tesla’s pledged patents versus similar control patents before and after 2014, we find that the pledge significantly increased follow-on innovation by 70% overall. However, this effect is entirely driven by firms outside the traditional automotive sector—particularly battery and electronics companies—while incumbent automakers showed no significant response. The results are strongest for Tesla’s battery technologies, which experienced a 218% increase in citation rates from non-automotive sectors post-pledge. Our findings suggest that patent pledges can effectively accelerate cross-sector knowledge diffusion and ecosystem development, but their impact depends critically on the competitive dynamics between pledge-making firms and potential adopters. These results have important implications for innovation policy and corporate strategy in emerging technology sectors.</span>"
